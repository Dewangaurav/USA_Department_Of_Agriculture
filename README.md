- **State**: The state where the production data is reported.
- **Year**: The year in which the production data is recorded.
- **Commodity**: The type of agricultural commodity being produced (e.g., cheese, milk, honey).
- **Value**: The quantity or production value of the commodity reported for the state and year.

#### Analysis Questions
1. **Highest Total Cheese Production**: Identify the state with the highest total cheese production each year and calculate the percentage increase in production if the state remains the same across consecutive years.
   
2. **Percentage Change in Milk Production**: Calculate the percentage change in milk production for California from 2022 to 2023.
   
3. **Top States in Total Production**: Find the top 3 states with the highest total production across all commodities combined in the year 2023.
   
4. **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in Milk Production**: Determine the state with the highest Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in milk production from 2015 to 2023.
   
5. **Highest Percentage Share of National Coffee Production**: Identify the state and year with the highest percentage share of national coffee production.
   
6. **Average Annual Growth Rate in Honey Production**: Rank the states by their average annual growth rate in honey production from 2010 to 2022.
   
7. **Highest Percentage Increase in Honey Production**: Identify the state with the highest percentage increase in honey production from 2021 to 2022.
   
8. **Yogurt Production Analysis**: Find states where yogurt production data is available for most years in the dataset, and calculate the average production per year for these states.

#### Conclusion
This project utilizes SQL queries to explore and analyze trends in agricultural production across different states and commodities based on data provided by the USA Department of Agriculture. By examining production levels, growth rates, and percentage changes over time, insights can be derived to understand which states are leading in various agricultural sectors and how production dynamics evolve annually.
